Dear Mujawamariya,

Thank you for your interest in the Andela Fellowship. This e-mail is an invitation to begin taking the HomeStudy Assessment which is based on the Homestudy Curriculum. The assessment will help determine the next generation of Andela Engineers.

Please follow this link to complete the preliminary assessment which tests your ability to apply knowledge you should have gained before this stage in the application process. The start time is 8pm on Saturday, June 1st, 2019 and the deadline for completion is 10am on Wednesday, June 5th, 2019.

    The assessment platform requires that you login with a GitHub account.
    If you don’t have one already, please create an account on GitHub with the email address you applied to Andela with. This is very important, else we might have a hard time tracking your application beyond this stage
    Ensure you take the assessment on Chrome and follow the instructions on the assessment carefully.
    When you’re done with a challenge, click the play icon button in the top left menu of the screen. The system will automatically take you to the next challenge if you have met the requirements for the current challenge.
    Candidates who meet the performance threshold for this assessment stage will be sent another assessment which further tests technical competency and will be invited to an onsite interview based on performance.
    Successful interviewees will be invited to our two week immersive Bootcamp program which leads successful candidates into Andela.


if possible you could sent again assessment to do.
